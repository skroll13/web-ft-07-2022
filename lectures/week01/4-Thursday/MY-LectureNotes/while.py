#1. Create a program that will print from 1-10 using a while loop.
# number = 1
# while number <= 10:
#     print(number)
#     number += 1

#2. Create a program that will print from 10-1 using a while loop.

# number = 10
# while number >= 10:
#     print(number)
#     number -= 1

#3. Create a program that prompts the user to enter a word.  The program doesn't stop asking the user to enter a word until the user enters the word "stop"

# user_answer = input("please enter a word or I will keep asking ... (forever) >> ")

# while user_answer.lower() != "stop":
#     print(user_answer)
#     user_answer = input("please enter a word or I will keep asking ... (forever) >> ") 
#     if user_answer == "stop":
#         print("well done")

#4a. Create a program that has a variable named username and another variabled named password with values of your choice.
username = "YourName"
password = "Password!"

#4b. Prompt the user for a username and then a password.
username = input("Enter your username >> ")
password = input("Enter your password >> ")

#4c. If the both match continue on with the program and give a welcome message.


#4d. If not it prompts the user for the username and password until they get it correct.

#4e. (bonus) have a limited amount of attempts and if they reach the limit it tells the user and exits the program.

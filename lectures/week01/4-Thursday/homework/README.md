## Iterative Programming

#### 1. Multiply Vectors

Given two lists of numbers of the same length, create a new list by multiplying the pairs of numbers in corresponding positions in the two lists. Example:

```
[2, 4, 5] x [2, 3, 6] = [4, 12, 30]
```

#### 2. Matrix Addition

Given two two-dimensional lists of numbers of the size 2x2 two dimensional list is represented as an list of lists:

```
[ [2, -2],
   [5, 3] ]
```

Calculate the result of adding the two matrices. The number in each position in the resulting matrix should be the sum of the numbers in the corresponding addend matrices. Example: to add

```
1 3
2 4
```
and

```
5 2
1 0
```

results in

```
6 5
3 4
```

#### 3. Matrix Addition II

Use your solution in Matrix Addition, and extend it to work for a pair of matrices of any size, as long as they have the same size.

#### 4. De-dup

Given a list of numbers or strings, create a new list containing the same elements as the first list, except with any duplicate values removed. Print the list.

#### 5. Leetspeak

Given a paragraph of text as a String, print the paragraph in [leetspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet). 

To translate a String to leetspeak, you need to replace make the following character replacements (treat all input characters as uppercase):

| Letter | Translates To |
|:------:|:-------------:|
| A      | 4             |
| E      | 3             |
| G      | 6             |
| I      | 1             |
| O      | 0             |
| S      | 5             |
| T      | 7             |

Example: If your program is given the String `"I am a leet programmer"`, it should print `"1 4m 4 l337 pr0gr4mm3r"` as the leetspeak translation

#### 6. Long-long Vowels

Given a word as a string, print the result of extending any long vowels to the length of 5. 

Examples:

```
Good => Goooood 
Cheese => Cheeeeese 
Man => Man 
Spoon => Spooooon 
```

#### 7. Caesar Cipher

Given a string, print the Caesar Cipher (or ROT13) of that string. What is Caesar Cipher? [Learn about it here](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/).

Use your solution to decipher the following text: "lbh zhfg hayrnea jung lbh unir yrnearq"

### Matrix Multiplication
Given two two-dimensional lists of numbers of the size 2x2 - calculate the result of multiplying the two matrices. Print the resulting matrix.

How do you multiple two matrices?

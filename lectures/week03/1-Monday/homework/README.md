10. Create a basic website!


- Start with the home page at index.html 
- Create pages for individual topics. 
    - These can your interest, passions, family, cats, or anything else. 
- Link the different pages to one another (via nav or links in the content). 
- Include images Make use of tags you learned Make use of CSS styling
- Host your site on github pages 
- Make 5-10 different pages. Put good content in them

A few ideas:

- Document a few of the python projects you created with screenshots, pre-formatted code, and a brief description. 
- Create a hypertext version of notes you've taken during class, including links to external resources. 
- Create a (hopefully non-creepy) fan page for something you love.

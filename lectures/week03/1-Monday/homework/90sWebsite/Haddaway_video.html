    <h2>What is Love?</h2>
    <p>The music video for this song is what really takes it over the top. I mean, it's a doozy on it's own but give it a watch for just 10 seconds and you'll know what I'm talking about. That said, if you were listening to any pop radio station in 1993, you know all of the words to this song.</p>
